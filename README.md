# SolidityIntermediate

The `FunctionsandErrorsContract` is a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates exception handling using the `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements. It showcases different scenarios where these statements can be used to handle exceptions, validate conditions, and ensure the correctness of operations.

## Contract Overview

The contract manages a balance and provides various functions to interact with it:

- `deposit(uint amount)`: Allows users to deposit funds into the contract. It uses `require()` to ensure the amount being deposited is greater than zero.
- `withdraw(uint amount)`: Enables users to withdraw funds from the contract. It uses `require()` to check if the requested amount is available in the contract's balance.
- `divide(uint numerator, uint denominator)`: Performs division of two numbers. It uses `require()` to validate that the denominator is not zero before performing the division operation.
- `multiply(uint a, uint b)`: Multiplies two numbers and returns the result. It uses `assert()` to verify the correctness of the multiplication result.
- `transfer(address payable recipient, uint amount)`: Transfers funds from the contract to a recipient address. It uses `require()` to check if the contract's balance is sufficient for the transfer.
- `triggerRevert(uint number)`: Demonstrates the use of `revert()` to intentionally revert the transaction with a custom error message. Additional logic can be performed after the `revert()` statement.

## Getting Started

To use the `FunctionsandErrorsContract`, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network compatible with Solidity version ^0.8.0.
2. Interact with the contract by calling its functions, such as `deposit`, `withdraw`, `divide`, `multiply`, `transfer`, and `triggerRevert`.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the contract's functions:

```solidity
// Deploy the contract

// Deposit funds
contract.deposit(100);

// Withdraw funds
contract.withdraw(50);

// Perform division
uint result = contract.divide(10, 2);

// Perform multiplication
uint product = contract.multiply(5, 10);

// Transfer funds to another address
contract.transfer(recipientAddress, 25);

// Trigger a revert
contract.triggerRevert(0);
